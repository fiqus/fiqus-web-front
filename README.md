  Fiqus web - dev and deploy notes
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run in dev mode.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!


4.  **Build and deploy**

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
    Will create or update the build folder that should be uploaded to the server. 

## IMPORTANT ðŸš¨ AFTER A DEPLOY: WEBSITE BREAKS, set again domain
Go to:
https://github.com/fiqus/fiqus-web-front/settings/pages
and you have to fill again the "Custom domain" field with "fiqus.coop"
and save... it will take a few seconds to do finish with a  "DNS check successful" message and website should be back working
