That is how the idea of building a social enterprise was born, that is how Fiqus was born.","culture_historia.content_line3":"Over the years, we have built an organizational structure that adapts to people and not the other way around. This is how, as we went along and based on the experience acquired, we built a series of agreements that today are part of our internal regulations. Our rules and regulations are not static, they are living things that evolve according to the evolution of the people who are part of our organization. This is where we reflect our concrete proposals to ensure that the people who participate in the collective are placed at the center of the production processes.","culture_historia.content_line4":"We like to think that Fiqus is a proposal that invites those who are not familiar with technological cooperativism to see that a paradigm shift is possible.","culture_historia.subtitle":"We are organized horizontally and democratically!","culture_historia.content_line5":"The decisions of the cooperative are made at the Ordinary General Assembly once a year.

That is why we work actively in the Associativism Board of Villa La Angostura, Neuqu√©n.

We traveled to the United Kingdom to meet technology cooperatives from a local network.

We share weekly meetings where we learn about our cultures, discuss our common goals and outline a roadmap to grow the community that composes it. Little by little, we begin to intercooperate with the objective of strengthening our local constructions with a global scale. In this way, organized, technology cooperatives will be able to help each other through cooperation to sell and develop projects together.","labs.title":"Labs","labs.subtitle":"FiqusLabs is a space where we research new technologies and train ourselves.","labs.content":"In addition, learning a new technology often comes with the ability to implement a project that benefits the community or the cooperative environment.","casos_de_exito.title":"Case Studies","casos_de_exito.tagsTitle":"Researched Technologies","casos_de_exito.imageAltLine1":"project image","casos_de_exito.btnTextVerMas":"view more","casos_de_exito.btnTextGithub":"go to Github","blog.title":"Blog","blogPost.tagsTitle":"Related tags","blogPost.relatesPost":"Related articles","blogPost.verTodosBtn":"See all articles","page404.title":"Error 404","page404.descriptionLine1":"We couldn't find what you were looking for.
