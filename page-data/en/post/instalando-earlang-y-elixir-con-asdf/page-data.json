Fiqus.</p>\n<p>Elixir es un lenguaje funcional dinámico, distribuido y tolerante a fallas que viene teniendo un gran crecimiento en los últimos años y en Fiqus comenzamos a adoptarlo como una de nuestras principales tecnologías.</p>\n<p>Para utilizar Elixir es necesario tener instalado Erlang, ya que corre sobre su máquina virtual (Erlang VM/BEAM) el código compilado a beam.</p>\n<p>La forma más tradicional de instalación está más que clara en la <a href=\"https://elixir-lang.org/install.html\">guía de instalación de Elixir</a>, pero nosotros recomendamos utilizar un Version Manager llamado <a href=\"https://github.com/asdf-vm/\">asdf</a>, que además de estas tecnologías, tiene una amplia gama de <a href=\"https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins\">plugins</a> para manejo de muchas otras.\nLa gran ventaja de utilizar un manejador de versiones es que podemos instalar más de una versión en nuestro sistema y cambiar libremente entre ellas para el proyecto que lo requiera.</p>\n<p>Entonces, arrancamos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Instalamos asdf como dice aquí:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf#setup\">https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf#setup</a></p>\n<p>No olvidar instalar las dependencias que dice abajo, por ejemplo para Ubuntu:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">automake autoconf libreadline-dev libncurses-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libxslt-dev libffi-dev libtool unixodbc-dev</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p><em>Si no tenemos autotools se pueden instalar con apt.</em></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Luego agregamos plugin de Erlang y de Elixir:</li>\n</ol>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf plugin-add erlang</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf plugin-add elixir</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<br />\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Instalamos las versiones deseadas de cada lenguaje:</li>\n</ol>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf install erlang 20.0</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf install elixir 1.6.1</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>Las versiones al momento de escribir este post.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Seteamos global o localmente la versión deseada</li>\n</ol>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf global erlang 20.0</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf global elixir 1.6.1</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>Para validar que funcionan podemos luego en una consola escribir:\n<code>erl</code> (para Erlang) y <code>iex</code> (para Elixir)</p>\n<p>También podemos instalar <a href=\"https://www.rebar3.org/\">rebar3</a>, el administrador de paquetes de Erlang de la misma manera:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code  terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">asdf plugin-add rebar\nasdf install rebar 3.4.7\nasdf global rebar 3.4.7</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>","frontmatter":{"lang":"es","type":"post","title":"Instalando Erlang y Elixir con asdf","author":"Pablo
