Para poder determinarlo, debemos analizar y medir el mercado, el comportamiento de nuestros potenciales usuarios / clientes, intentar conocerlos y \"traducir\" todo ello en un producto lo más cercano a sus necesidades, tanto utilitarias como monetarias. Como cooperativa, varias veces surgió la discusión sobre qué precio le debemos poner a lo que hacemos y considerando que no disponemos de materias primas a utilizar (más que nuestra masa gris) esto resulta extremadamente difícil. Con el paso del tiempo, llegamos a la conclusión (tan absoluta como temporal) de establecer el precio de lo que hacemos en base a la búsqueda de nuestro bienestar y no a sacarle el mayor provecho a los clientes (cosa que sucede muy a menudo en el mundo capitalista en el que vivimos).\nCómo creen que debería establecerse el precio del producto de nuestro trabajo?</p>\n<p>Tuve la suerte de leer algún capítulo de <a href=\"http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=H7hZUf17PXMC&#x26;lpg=PA49&#x26;ots=0EQu0IZcJr&#x26;dq=Analiza%20y%20comprende%20cu%C3%A1nto%20inviertes%20en%20producir%20y%20vender%20tu%20informaci%C3%B3n.%20La%20informaci%C3%B3n%20es%20cara%20de%20producir%20pero%20barata%20de%20reproducir&#x26;hl=es&#x26;pg=PA49#v=onepage&#x26;q=Analiza%20y%20comprende%20cu%C3%A1nto%20inviertes%20en%20producir%20y%20vender%20tu%20informaci%C3%B3n.%20La%20informaci%C3%B3n%20es%20cara%20de%20producir%20pero%20barata%20de%20reproducir&#x26;f=false\">\"El dominio de la información\"</a> de Varian y Shapiro, ahora los dejo con algunas valiosas lecciones extraídas:</p>\n<p>• Analiza y comprende cuánto inviertes en producir y vender tu información. <strong>La información es cara de producir pero barata de reproducir</strong>. Altos costes enterrados de entrada, límites de capacidad mínimas y unos costes incrementales bajos hacen que sólo unas pocas estructuras de mercado sean viables. Entender cómo va a sobrevivir nuestra empresa es fundamental para formular una estrategia efectiva a largo plazo.</p>\n<p>• Si te fuerzan a competir en un mercado de mercancías, sé agresivo pero no codicioso. Si se trata de una de las muchas empresas que venden información similar, hazte con una cuota de mercado y explota las economías de escala para convertirte en un productor con bajos costes. Busca la manera de <strong>añadir valor a la información</strong> por medio de una organización superior, de un formato apropiado, y de salir en el momento oportuno.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Diferencia tu producto</strong> personalizando la información y el precio. Crea un producto que sea único para así poder basar el precio en el valor que se ofrece al consumidor en lugar de basarlo en los precios que fija la competencia.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Invierte en obtener datos sobre tu mercado y en analizarlos</strong>, usando dinámicas de grupos, análisis estadísticos, promociones y otras técnicas comerciales. Estudiar el mercado en tiempo real resulta más barato en Internet que por medios convencionales, así que aprovecha la información de las secuencias de clics de tus clientes.</p>\n<p>• Utiliza la información sobre tus clientes para venderles productos a <strong>precios personalizados</strong>. Se pueden usar historiales de compra, solicitudes de búsqueda y secuencias de clics para diferenciar precios y productos.</p>\n<p>Saludos y hasta la próxima!</p>","frontmatter":{"lang":"es","type":"post","title":"Cuánto vale lo que hacemos?","author":"Martín Vallone","slug":"/cuanto-vale","date":"2013-08-22","tags":["coop","cooperativa"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.5641025641025643,"src":"/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/14b42/cuanto-vale-header.jpg","srcSet":"/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/f836f/cuanto-vale-header.jpg 200w,\n/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/2244e/cuanto-vale-header.jpg 400w,\n/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/14b42/cuanto-vale-header.jpg 800w,\n/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/47498/cuanto-vale-header.jpg 1200w,\n/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/0e329/cuanto-vale-header.jpg 1600w,\n/static/446dfe9cb3d3c3b5d19aa1adb5061fdf/52258/cuanto-vale-header.jpg 1800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"imageCredits":"unsplash"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cuanto-vale","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["es","en"],"messages":{"Home":"Home","Servicios":"Services","Cultura":"Culture","Labs":"Labs","Blog":"Blog","Articles":"Articles","footer.designby":"Intercooperative work made by","footer.coopName":"el maizal and nayra","footer.disclaimer":"Unless stated otherwise, content on this site is licensed under ","footer.licenseName":"Creative Commons Attribution","footer.licenseIconAlt":"Creative Commons Attribution logo","header.logoAlt":"logo Fiqus","header.iconTogglerAlt":"icon to open menu","header.iconTogglerCloseAlt":"icon to close menu","homepage.title":"Homepage","homepage.imageAlt":" ","homepage.imageAltMobile":" ","homepage.leadLine1":"We are a ","homepage.leadUnderlined":"software cooperative ","homepage.leadLine2":"We are ","homepage.leadBold":"collective construction","homepage.leadLine3":", culture and minds in constant motion.","homepageCulture.title":"Culture","homepageCulture.birdImage":"bird.svg","homepageCulture.birdImageAlt":"illustration of a bird","homepageCulture.image":"homepageCulture.svg","homepageCulture.imageAlt":"illustration depicting the culture section","homepageCulture.descriptionLine1":"We have a superpower: We own the company we work for!
