Esta nos orienta a tomar decisiones para corregir ciertos desvíos en determinados aspectos de la empresa y planificar a un corto/mediano plazo. Por ejemplo, conocer los ingresos que se van a percibir próximamente, permiten decidir sobre realizar una inversión, una modificación del anticipo o generar ahorro para la cooperativa de manera consciente.</p>\n<p>En el marco de la administración de cooperativas es evidente la necesidad de conocer los movimientos de fondos, tanto ingresos como egresos, su relación y, a través de esto dar cuenta de los resultados de la cooperativa en cuanto a lo que necesita para su subsistencia y la de sus socios.</p>\n<p>Antes vamos a dejar dos conceptos que nos serán de utilidad para entender mejor lo que abordaremos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cuando hablamos en sentido económico,  nos referimos a un concepto que abarca lo sucedido en el mes. En este caso, nos centraremos en si lo facturado en el mes cubre los gastos incurrido en el mismo. Es decir, se computa una vez perfeccionado el negocio, ya sea con la factura o el remito, no cuando se paga o se cobra.</li>\n<li>Por otro lado, lo financiero significa lo contrario. Cobros reales contra gastos realmente efectuados.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Finanzas</h1>\n<p>Siguiendo con la muestra de documentos que nos parecen útiles y con la idea presentada en el párrafo anterior, les presentamos una planilla que representa el análisis mes a mes del desempeño y evolución de la cooperativa en el aspecto económico y financiero a la vez. Nosotros la denominamos Fiqu-Finanzas y consta de varias columnas, las cuales detallamos a continuación:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facturado en el mes</li>\n<li>Ingresos de Caja y Banco, que forman un Total de ingresos</li>\n<li>Egresos de Caja y Banco, que forman un Total de egresos (*)</li>\n<li>En la siguiente columna se hace la resta de (Ingresos – Egresos), lo que nos da el Resultado del mes. Es el resultado financiero (se refiere al movimiento de fondos).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>La importancia de éste resultado es saber que ganancia dio el mes, y al medirlo en varios meses, se puede saber si se mejora o empeora el rendimiento de la cooperativa.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finalmente el Acumulado. En esta columna hay que realizar la suma del saldo de Caja y Banco anterior y el Resultado del mes. Éste número representa el total de lo que tiene la empresa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Si uno quisiera abordar el análisis económico, se puede llegar a una conclusión comparando el nivel de gastos del mes contra lo facturado. Un claro indicador es ver si lo que se produce llega a cubrir los gastos/egresos (*).</p>\n<p>(*) Es importante llevar en una planilla separada la cuenta de los gastos fijos habituales para tener un control sobre los mismos o como una posibilidad de proyección de estos, poder hacer un análisis a futuro y así, tener información adecuada para tomar las decisiones que sean necesarias.</p>\n<p>Los despedimos, esperamos que les sirva y nos re-encontramos en la Parte 3!</p>","frontmatter":{"lang":"es","type":"post","title":"Administración de Cooperativas (Parte 2)","author":"Leandro Bugge","slug":"/administracion-cooperativa-parte-2","date":"2013-10-09","tags":["administración","cooperativismo"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4492753623188406,"src":"/fiqus-web-front/static/62c495f81224c0d5f6e914392e4b3c40/14b42/administracion-cooperativa-2.jpg","srcSet":"/fiqus-web-front/static/62c495f81224c0d5f6e914392e4b3c40/f836f/administracion-cooperativa-2.jpg 200w,\n/fiqus-web-front/static/62c495f81224c0d5f6e914392e4b3c40/2244e/administracion-cooperativa-2.jpg 400w,\n/fiqus-web-front/static/62c495f81224c0d5f6e914392e4b3c40/14b42/administracion-cooperativa-2.jpg 800w,\n/fiqus-web-front/static/62c495f81224c0d5f6e914392e4b3c40/47498/administracion-cooperativa-2.jpg 1200w,\n/fiqus-web-front/static/62c495f81224c0d5f6e914392e4b3c40/aed41/administracion-cooperativa-2.jpg 1296w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"imageCredits":"unsplash"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/administracion-cooperativa-parte-2","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["es","en"],"messages":{"Home":"Home","Servicios":"Services","Cultura":"Culture","Labs":"Labs","Blog":"Blog","Articles":"Articles","footer.designby":"Intercooperative work made by","footer.coopName":"el maizal and nayra","footer.disclaimer":"Unless stated otherwise, content on this site is licensed under ","footer.licenseName":"Creative Commons Attribution","footer.licenseIconAlt":"Creative Commons Attribution logo","header.logoAlt":"logo Fiqus","header.iconTogglerAlt":"icon to open menu","header.iconTogglerCloseAlt":"icon to close menu","homepage.title":"Homepage","homepage.imageAlt":" ","homepage.imageAltMobile":" ","homepage.leadLine1":"We are a ","homepage.leadUnderlined":"software cooperative ","homepage.leadLine2":"We are ","homepage.leadBold":"collective construction","homepage.leadLine3":", culture and minds in constant motion.","homepageCulture.title":"Culture","homepageCulture.birdImage":"bird.svg","homepageCulture.birdImageAlt":"illustration of a bird","homepageCulture.image":"homepageCulture.svg","homepageCulture.imageAlt":"illustration depicting the culture section","homepageCulture.descriptionLine1":"We have a superpower: We own the company we work for!
