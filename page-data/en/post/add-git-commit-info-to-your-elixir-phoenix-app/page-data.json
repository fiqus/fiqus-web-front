    "result": {"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hi there! We’d like to share how to add git repo information to an <a href=\"https://elixir-lang.org/\">Elixir</a> application. In our use case, we wanted to add last commit hash and date to be displayed at <a href=\"https://github.com/fiqus/lqchatex\">Live Qchatex</a> app footer, but it wasn’t as trivial as we expected.</p>\n<p>The basic idea was to rely on git console commands to get the desired information:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"elixir\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">defp get_commit_sha() do\n  System.cmd(&quot;git&quot;, [&quot;rev-parse&quot;, &quot;HEAD&quot;])\n  |&gt; elem(0)\n  |&gt; String.trim()\nend\n\ndefp get_commit_date() do\n  [sec, tz] =\n    System.cmd(&quot;git&quot;, ~w|log -1 --date=raw --format=%cd|)\n    |&gt; elem(0)\n    |&gt; String.split(~r/\\s+/, trim: true)\n    |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;String.to_integer/1)\n\n  DateTime.from_unix!(sec + tz * 36)\nend</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>That’s pretty easy! BUT, only works as long as the <code>.git</code> directory lives within the same directory where your app is started (ie: at runtime).\nIn cases like building a <a href=\"https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-released/\">mix release</a> or deploying the code to <a href=\"https://gigalixir.com/\">gigalixir</a>, things started to get complicated!</p>\n<p>Besides not having the .git directory, we didn’t like the idea of calling <code>System.cmd(...)</code> to get the git repo data each time we wanted to display that information at frontend.\nSounds a little expensive and makes not much sense, right?\nSo, how can we improve this in order to NOT rely on .git directory and to avoid issuing nosense syscalls?</p>\n<h1>The ‘VERSION’ file</h1>\n<p>One solution that came to mind was to <strong>write the git repo info to a static file</strong> and then <strong>read it when the app starts</strong>. Now the question is: <strong>when and where</strong> to do such things?</p>\n<h1>Write the ‘VERSION’ file</h1>\n<p>One approach is to “override” the mix task <code>mix deps.get</code> and call a function that will get the git repo info and saves it every time the dependencies are updated.\nThis can be easily done at <code>mix.exs</code>:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"elixir\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">defmodule MyApp.MixProject do\n  use Mix.Project\n\n  def project do\n    [\n      app: :my_app,\n      version: version(),\n      aliases: aliases(),\n      ...\n    ]\n  end\n\n  defp version, do: &quot;1.1.1&quot;\n\n  ...\n\n  defp aliases do\n    [\n      &quot;deps.get&quot;: [&quot;deps.get&quot;, &amp;update_version/1]\n    ]\n  end\n\n  defp update_version(_) do\n    contents = [\n      version(),\n      get_commit_sha(),\n      get_commit_date()\n    ]\n\n    Mix.shell().info(&quot;Updating version with: #{inspect(contents)}&quot;)\n    File.write(&quot;VERSION&quot;, Enum.join(contents, &quot;\\n&quot;), [:write])\n  end\n\n  defp get_commit_sha() do\n    System.cmd(&quot;git&quot;, [&quot;rev-parse&quot;, &quot;HEAD&quot;])\n    |&gt; elem(0)\n    |&gt; String.trim()\n  end\n\n  defp get_commit_date() do\n    [sec, tz] =\n      System.cmd(&quot;git&quot;, ~w|log -1 --date=raw --format=%cd|)\n      |&gt; elem(0)\n      |&gt; String.split(~r/\\s+/, trim: true)\n      |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;String.to_integer/1)\n\n    DateTime.from_unix!(sec + tz * 36)\n  end\nend</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>NOTE: Don’t forget to add <code>/VERSION</code> it to <code>.gitignore</code>!</p>\n<p>Surelly, that approach can be improved to ensure updating the version every time the app is deployed no matter the “deployment mode” you may choose (ie: running <code>mix release</code> it will NOT update the version, despite we could add that alias to be overriden too..?).\nSuggestions are welcome! =]</p>\n<h1>Read the ‘VERSION’ file</h1>\n<p>Again, one approach is to read and parse the VERSION file contents at application start.\nTo do that, we add some lines to <code>application.ex</code> file:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"elixir\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">defmodule MyApp.Application do\n  use Application\n  require Logger\n\n  def start(_type, _args) do\n    # Load application version\n    load_version()\n    ...\n  end\n\n  def version, do: Application.get_env(:my_app, :version)\n  def version(key), do: version()[key]\n\n  defp load_version() do\n    [vsn, hash, date] =\n      case File.read(&quot;VERSION&quot;) do\n        {:ok, data} -&gt; data |&gt; String.split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\n        _ -&gt; [nil, nil, nil]\n      end\n\n    version = %{vsn: vsn, hash: hash, date: date}\n    Logger.info(&quot;Loading app version: #{inspect(version)}&quot;)\n    Application.put_env(:my_app, :version, version)\n  end\nend</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>That way we archieved to load the version info and to set it at application env scope by doing:</p>\n<p><code>Application.put_env(:my_app, :version, version)</code></p>\n<p>Now, to retrieve the version values at runtime, we could directly call:</p>\n<p><code>Application.get_env(:my_app, :version)</code></p>\n<p>But we added a little helper to abstract it a little:</p>\n<p><code>MyApp.Application.version()</code></p>\n<h1>Displaying the version info in a Phoenix View</h1>\n<p>We could add some code to the <code>layout_view.ex</code> in order to easily display the current version info in a view:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"elixir\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">defmodule MyApp.LayoutView do\n  use MyAppWeb, :view\n\n  def render_version(),\n    do: &quot;MyApp &lt;b&gt;v#{get_app_version()}.#{get_commit_date()}&lt;/b&gt; at #{get_commit_link()}&quot;\n\n  def repo_url(path \\\\ &quot;&quot;),\n    do: Application.get_env(:my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint)[:repo] &lt;&gt; path\n\n  defp get_app_version(), do: Application.spec(:my_app, :vsn)\n  defp get_commit_sha(), do: MyApp.Application.version(:hash)\n  defp get_commit_date(), do: MyApp.Application.version(:date)\n\n  defp get_commit_link() do\n    commit_sha = get_commit_sha()\n    path = &quot;/commit/#{commit_sha}&quot;\n\n    &quot;&lt;a href=\\&quot;#{repo_url(path)}\\&quot; target=\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;&gt;##{commit_sha}&lt;/a&gt;&quot;\n  end\nend</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>NOTE: The function <code>get_commit_link()</code> calls <code>repo_url(path)</code> that gets the repo url from a custom config param manually set:\n<code>Application.get_env(:my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint)[:repo]</code>\nBy having defined at <code>config.exs</code>:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"elixir\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">config :my_app, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,\n  environment: Mix.env(),\n  repo: &quot;https://github.com/my_repo&quot;</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>And lastly, in a view template like <code>app.html.eex</code> just add:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"elixir\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">&lt;footer&gt;&lt;%= raw render_version() %&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<h1>..and voilà!</h1>\n<p>It should print something like:</p>\n<p><code>MyApp v0.1.1.2019-07-14 17:12:51Z at #c76563d34...</code></p>\n<p>Hope it helped someone and please feel free to post your comments and suggestions!
