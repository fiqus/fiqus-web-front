It has an architecture where the front-end application decides what data to fetch and how much the server should return. Meanwhile, when using REST, everything is designed on the server, so the server drives the architecture.</p>\n<p>There are no over-fetching and under-fetching issues. One advantage of GraphQl over REST is that REST responses contain too much data or sometimes not enough, which creates the need for another request. GraphQL solves this problem by fetching only the exact and specific data in a single request.</p>\n<p>But this is not a rivalry, they can be complementary! the way in which the execution environment that resolves the queries can access any kind of data source, such as a database ORM or 3rd party API calls.</p>\n<h1>Why and when to use?</h1>\n<p>A good situation to use GraphQL is when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your application needs to handle a large number of different queries and mutations, and a traditional REST API would be difficult to manage.</li>\n<li>Your application needs to handle a variety of different data types, and a GraphQL schema allows for better organization and documentation of the data.</li>\n<li>Your client-side application needs to have precise control over the data it receives from the server, and GraphQL allows for greater flexibility in data retrieval and querying.</li>\n<li>Your application is going to be used by other developers or third-party systems and you want to provide them with a clear and well-documented API.</li>\n<li>Your application needs to handle real-time updates and subscriptions, GraphQL provides native support for subscriptions which can help you implement this feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reasons to use GraphQL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flexibility: allows the client to request only the specific data it needs, avoiding data overload or underestimation.</li>\n<li>Strong typing: GraphQL provides a clear and easy to understand schema, allowing for better documentation and more robust error handling.</li>\n<li>Efficient: since the client can specify exactly what data it needs, multiple requests can often be combined into a single request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reasons not to use GraphQL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning curve: GraphQL has a steeper learning curve than REST, and developers may need to spend more time getting familiar with it.</li>\n<li>Caching: GraphQL does not have built-in caching mechanisms, which can make it more difficult to cache server responses.</li>\n<li>Overloading: if the client specifies too much data in its request, it can end up overloading, which can lead to performance issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pros and cons</h1>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GraphQL is much faster than other communication APIs because it makes it easier to reduce requests by choosing only the specific fields you want to query.</li>\n<li>Complex systems and microservices. We can integrate multiple systems behind the GraphQL API. It unifies them and hides their complexity. The GraphQL server is also used to pull data from existing systems and package it into the GraphQL response format. This is very beneficial for legacy infrastructures or third-party APIs that are huge in size and difficult to maintain and manage. When we have to migrate from a monolithic backend application to a microservices architecture, the GraphQL API can help us manage communication between multiple microservices by merging into a GraphQL schema.</li>\n<li>Define a form of data: When we make GraphQL request to the server, it returns the response in a simple, secure and predictable form. Thus, it makes it easy for you to write a specific query according to your requirement.</li>\n<li>Code sharing: We can share GraphQL fields used in multiple queries at a higher component level for reuse. This feature is known as fragments and allows you to get different data while keeping the same schema field.</li>\n<li>GraphQL is a strongly typed language where each level of a GraphQL query corresponds to a particular type, and each type describes a set of available fields. Therefore, it is similar to SQL and provides descriptive error messages before executing a query.</li>\n<li>Introspection: We can query a GraphQL server for its support types. It creates a powerful platform for tools and client software such as the framework, Relay, or IDEs such as GraphiQL. GraphiQL makes it easy for developers to learn and explore an API quickly.</li>\n<li>The latest version is not required. In GraphQL, the result set or data returned is very specific to the client query, so it is very simple and easy for the server to generalize it. When we add new product features, additional fields to the server, it does not affect the existing clients. You can use the previous server without any concern because the server fields may be obsolete but still work. This compatible process does not require the need for a growing version number. You can see that Facebook is using the same version of GraphQL API in their applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Queries always return an HTTP status code of 200, regardless of whether the query was successful or not. If the query is unsuccessful, your JSON response will have a top-level \"errors:\" key with associated error messages and stacktrace. This can make it much more difficult to do error handling.</li>\n<li>Depending on your implementation, GraphQL may require different API management strategies than REST APIs, especially when pricing and frequency limits are taken into account.</li>\n<li>The flexibility and richness of the query language also adds complexity that may not be worthwhile for simpler APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Basic example:</h1>\n<p>For this example we will be using the <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/\">apollo</a> library which gives us in this case a client for react and a server for nodeJS.\r\nThe schema defined will be a very simple schema of a blog where users can have associated posts</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"html\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">type User {\r\n  id: ID!\r\n  name: String!\r\n  lastName: String!\r\n  emails: [String!]\r\n  age: Int!\r\n  posts: [Post]\r\n}\r\ntype Post {\r\n  id: ID!\r\n  title: String!\r\n  content: String!\r\n}\r\ntype Query {\r\n  user(id: ID!): User\r\n  post(id: ID!): Post\r\n  allUsers: [User]\r\n  allPosts: [Post]\r\n}</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>Server:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"html\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">const { ApolloServer, gql } = require(&#39;apollo-server&#39;);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Define data types and resolvers\r\nconst typeDefs = gql`\r\n type User {\r\n   id: ID!\r\n   name: String!\r\n   lastName: String!\r\n   emails: [String!]\r\n   age: Int!\r\n   posts: [Post]\r\n }\r\n type Post {\r\n   id: ID!\r\n   title: String!\r\n   content: String!\r\n }\r\n type Query {\r\n   user(id: ID!): User\r\n   post(id: ID!): Post\r\n   allUsers: [User]\r\n   allPosts: [Post]\r\n }\r\n`;\r\n\r\n\r\nconst users = [\r\n { name: &#39;John&#39;, lastName: &#39;Doe&#39;, emails: [&#39;johndoe@example.com&#39;], age: 30 },\r\n { name: &#39;Jane&#39;, lastName: &#39;Doe&#39;, emails: [&#39;janedoe@example.com&#39;], age: 25 },\r\n];\r\n\r\n\r\nconst posts = [\r\n { id: &#39;1&#39;, title: &#39;My first post&#39;, content: &#39;This is my first post&#39; },\r\n { id: &#39;2&#39;, title: &#39;My second post&#39;, content: &#39;This is my second post&#39; },\r\n];\r\n\r\n\r\nconst resolvers = {\r\n Query: {\r\n   // In the resolvers we could make request to 3rd API&#39;s\r\n   user: (_, { id }) =&gt; users.find((user) =&gt; user.id === id),\r\n   post: (_, { id }) =&gt; posts.find((post) =&gt; post.id === id),\r\n   allUsers: () =&gt; users,\r\n   allPosts: () =&gt; posts,\r\n },\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\n// Instantiate the apollo server\r\nconst server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });\r\n\r\n// Start the server\r\nserver.listen().then(({ url }) =&gt; {\r\n console.log(`Server ready at ${url}`);\r\n});\r\n</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>React client</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"html\" terminal=\"ubuntu\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">import React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, gql, useQuery } from &#39;@apollo/client&#39;;\r\n\r\n\r\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\r\n uri: &#39;http://localhost:4000/graphql&#39;,\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction User({ id }) {\r\n const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(gql`\r\n   query User($id: ID!) {\r\n     user(id: $id) {\r\n       name\r\n       lastName\r\n       emails\r\n       age\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n `, { variables: { id } });\r\n\r\n\r\n if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;\r\n if (error) return &lt;p&gt;Error :(&lt;/p&gt;;\r\n\r\n\r\n return (\r\n   &lt;div&gt;\r\n     &lt;h2&gt;{data.user.name} {data.user.lastName}&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n     &lt;p&gt;Age: {data.user.age}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n     &lt;p&gt;Emails: {data.user.emails.join(&#39;, &#39;)}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;\r\n );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n return (\r\n   &lt;ApolloProvider client={client}&gt;\r\n     &lt;User id=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\r\n   &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;\r\n );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default App;</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>In this example, the User component uses the react-apollo hook useQuery to query the server for a specific user by ID.

Our rules and regulations are not static, they are living things that evolve according to the evolution of the people who are part of our organization. This is where we reflect our concrete proposals to ensure that the people who participate in the collective are placed at the center of the production processes.","culture_historia.content_line4":"We like to think that Fiqus is a proposal that invites those who are not familiar with technological cooperativism to see that a paradigm shift is possible.","culture_historia.subtitle":"We are organized horizontally and democratically!","culture_historia.content_line5":"The decisions of the cooperative are made at the Ordinary General Assembly once a year. In addition, as a collective organization, twice a year we hold a meeting where we think, based on our personal desires, about our objectives as a cooperative and we meet weekly (virtually) to plan the daily tasks.

In this way, as we have grown as people and as we have gone through the different scenarios that life has presented us with, we have prioritized accompanying the collective by providing the necessary support so that everyone can decide, for example, where and how to live.","culture_federales.tenemosSedes":"We currently have offices in ","culture_federales.y":"and","culture_federales.personasAsociadas":"But in addition, we have associates working from ","culture_federales.title2":"Territorial","culture_federales.content2":"As a worker cooperative, we understand ourselves as territorial social actors. Based on the seventh cooperative principle of 'Commitment to the Community', we assume the responsibility of extending the collective construction that we carry out day by day within the cooperative in the territory belonging to one of our locations. That is why we work actively in the Associativism Board of Villa La Angostura, Neuquén. There we meet periodically together with other actors of the social economy as well as with individuals committed to the local community to develop projects that enhance local initiatives, always with a collaborative and horizontal approach.","culture_facttic.title":"We are FACTTIC members!","culture_facttic.subtitle":"The federation is a national organization made up of technology cooperatives from all over Argentina.","culture_facttic.content_line1_part1":"It all started when the first cooperatives in the sector began to get in touch with each other because we understood that there is strength in unity to build a model that can scale with the goal of gradually becoming a real alternative to the traditional production model.

It is a space of collective creation where imagination applied to collaborative construction finds no limits.","culture_internacional.title":"International","culture_internacional.content_line1":"Several years after participating in the creation of the federation, we began to contact technology cooperatives in other parts of the world with the objective of sharing the collaboration and intercooperation model built with local cooperatives on a more global scale.","culture_internacional.content_line2":"After several interactions, we made our network's first international inter-cooperative trip. We traveled to the United Kingdom to meet technology cooperatives from a local network. We shared experiences and began to build the foundations of what is now the Global Community of Technology Worker Cooperatives.","culture_internacional.content_line3":"The network brings together more than 50 technology cooperatives from around the world, with presence in 16 countries from three different continents. We share weekly meetings where we learn about our cultures, discuss our common goals and outline a roadmap to grow the community that composes it. Little by little, we begin to intercooperate with the objective of strengthening our local constructions with a global scale. In this way, organized, technology cooperatives will be able to help each other through cooperation to sell and develop projects together.","labs.title":"Labs","labs.subtitle":"FiqusLabs is a space where we research new technologies and train ourselves.","labs.content":"In addition, learning a new technology often comes with the ability to implement a project that benefits the community or the cooperative environment.","casos_de_exito.title":"Case Studies","casos_de_exito.tagsTitle":"Researched Technologies","casos_de_exito.imageAltLine1":"project image","casos_de_exito.btnTextVerMas":"view more","casos_de_exito.btnTextGithub":"go to Github","blog.title":"Blog","blogPost.tagsTitle":"Related tags","blogPost.relatesPost":"Related articles","blogPost.verTodosBtn":"See all articles","page404.title":"Error 404","page404.descriptionLine1":"We couldn't find what you were looking for.
