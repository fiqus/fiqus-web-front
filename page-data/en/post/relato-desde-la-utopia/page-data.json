El hombre salió victorioso de la lucha interna contra el triste, mecánico y cómodo YO, aquel que ya no se preguntaba por qué, sino que aceptaba y seguía, y seguía, y seguía, siempre en el mismo lugar. Desechó el falso \"desarollo\" y se enfureció por seguir esa mentira de patas largas durante tanto tiempo. Se lanzó de lleno ante el nuevo espacio de creación. Inventó, creó y se organizó de nuevas formas, justas y equitativas. Se alejó de esa adictiva realidad virtual, y sin darse cuenta asumió su pertenencia a la naturaleza, solo con verla, con vivirla, con sentirla. La respetó y veneró. Utilizó sus ojos, sus oídos, nariz, boca y manos, y amó su cuerpo, su máxima herramienta.
